// MARK: - NEContentConfigurableView

/// A view that can be configured with a `Content` instance that contains the view's `Equatable`
/// properties that can be updated on existing view instances, e.g. text `String`s or image `URL`s.
///
/// For performance, it is generally expected that `Content` is only set when it is not equal to the
/// previous `Content` instance that has been set on a view instance. As a further optimization,
/// this view can guard updates on the equality of each property of the `Content` against the
/// current property value when set.
///
/// Properties of `Content` should be mutually exclusive with theÂ properties of the
/// `NEStyledView.Style` and `NEBehaviorsConfigurableView.Behaviors`.
///
